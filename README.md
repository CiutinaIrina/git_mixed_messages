Mixed Messages Codecademy project
=================================

## Introduction

This is a project used to display a random message to the console every time the algorithm is executed.

## The Project Structure

The messages depict a day in the life of a woman named Sarah. She spends all of her day doing all sorts of activities, some of which may be chores.

Sarah needs to complete all of her chores by the end of the day, or else she will get kicked out by her angry roommates.

Sarah can only complete a limited amount of activities per day. No activity can be completed twice. Depending on Sarah's personality traits, she is more likely to complete some activities over others. For example, a workaholic Sarah will prioritize her chores, while a lazy Sarah will prefer Netflix and video games.

## Technical Inforamtion

There is only one important file - message.js - that contains the code. The plans.txt file contains the notes made during the planning stages.

The project is entirely written in JavaScript.

The project is complete.

I recommend to execute the code using a node.js console.
